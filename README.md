# Scrum Tips

https://www.scrumguides.org/

## Scrum is an empirical process control theory
* Knowledge comes from experience
* Decisions is based on what is known
### Empiricism is based on three pillars
* Transparency 
    * Aspects must be visible to those responsible for the outcome
- Inspection
    * Constant inspection must be done to detect undesirable variances
- Adaptation
    * If one or more aspects deviate outsite acceptable limits the process must be adjusted

#### Four formal events are done to keep the pillars in check:
* Sprint Planning
* Daily Scrum
* Sprint Review
* Sprint Retrospective

#### Five values should be embodied and lived by the scrum team:
* Commitment to achieve goals
* Courage to do the right think and work on tough problems
* Focus on the work of the sprint and the goals of scrum team
* Openness about the work challenges
* Respect to each other as capable, independent people


### Scrum Teams 

#### Self organizing and cross-functional. Optimizing flexibility, creativity and productivity. Three parties:
* Product Owner
    * Responsible for maximizing the value of the product
    * Clearly expressing product backlog items
    * Ordering the items in the product backlog to best achiev goals and missions
    * Optimizing the value of the work the dev. team performs
    * Ensuring product backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all
    * Ensuring dev. team understands items to the level needed
    
This work can be done by PO or let the devs do it, but PO remains accountable.
* Dev. Team
    * Self-Organizing
    * Cross-Functional
    * No titles, regardless of the work being performed
    * No sub-teams, regardless of domains
    * Individuals may have specialized skills, but accountability belongs to  dev. team as a whole

Fewer than three members decrease interaction and impacts in smaller productivity gains. More than nine members require too much coordination. PO and Scrum Master are excluded from this count.
* Scrum Master

Responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. Scrum master do this by helping others understand practices, rules and values.

* Services to PO
    * Ensures goals, scope, and product domain are understood by everyone on the scrum steam.
    * Finding techniques for effective Product Backlog Management
    * Helping Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items
    * Understanding product planning in an empirical environment
    * Ensuring PO known how to arrenge backlog to maximize value
    * Understanding and practicing agility and facilitating scrum events as requested or needed
* Services to Dev. Team
    * Coaching in self-organization and cross-functionality
    * Helping to create high-value products
    * Removing impediments to progress
    * Faciliting Scrum events as requested or needed
    * Coaching in organizational environments in which Scrum is not fully adopted and understood
* Services to Organization
    * Leading and coaching organization about Scrum adoption
    * Planning Scrum implementations within organization
    * Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact Scrum and empirical product development
    * Causing change that increases the productivity of the Scrum Team
    * Working with other Masters to increase effectiveness of the application of Scrum

### Scrum Events

Creates regularity and minimizes need for unexpected meetings. All events are time-boxed, *i. e.* have a time limit.

Once a sprint has started it's duration is fixed and cannot be shortened or lengthened. Remaining events may end whenever the purpose has been achieved.

Other events are designed to enable inspection and transparency.

* Sprint
    * One month or less in which a potential releasable product increment is created
    * A new sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous.

Consists of Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, dev. work, Sprint Review and Retrospective. Scope may be re-negotiated between PO and Dev. Team.

#### Cancelling Sprints

A sprint can be cancelled, only the PO has authority to cancel the Sprint, although the other parties may influence it. A Sprint would be cancelled if the goal becomes obsolete, it might occur if the company changes direction or if market conditions change.

When a sprint is cancelled, any completed tasks must be reviewed, it part of the work is releasable the PO typically accepts it.

#### Planning
The plan is a collaborative work of the entire scrum team. Is time boxed within 8 hours for a 1 month sprint. The Scrum Master ensures events take place and attendants understand its purpose. Needs to answer:
* What can be delivered in the increment resulting from this sprint?
    * Only the dev. team can assess what it accomplish over the upcoming sprint.
    * A sprint goal also needs to be crafted in the planning. (why we are building this increment)
* How will the work be achieved to increment the product?
    Estimate the effort and steps needed to accomplish the chosen increments

By the end of the planning the dev. team needs to be able to explain to PO and Scrum master how it intends to work.

#### Daily Scrum
15 minute time boxed event for the dev. team. It is held every day of the sprint. The team plans for the next 24 hours.

It is utilized to inspect progress towards the goal. Optimizes the probability that the devs. will meet the goal. The structure is dependant on the team, some use questions and some are more discussion open. Example:

* What did I do yesterday that helped meet the goal?
* What will I do today to help meet the goal?
* What impediments prevents or the team from meeting the goal?


Scrum Master ensures the team has the meetings, but team is responsible for conducting the daily scrum. If others are present the master ensures they do not disrupt the meeting.

Advantages:

1. Improves Communication
2. Eliminate other meetings
3. Identify impediments and promotes quick decision-making
4. Key inspect and adapt meeting.

#### Review

Held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. The Scrum Team and Stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint. Attendees discuss on the things that could be done to optimize value. This is an informal meeting, and the presentation of the increment is intended to gather feedback.

This is at most a 4 hour meeting for one month Sprints. Scrum master ensures that the attendees understand its purpose.

* Attendees include Scrum Team and stakeholders invited by PO;
* PO explains what Product Backlog items have been "Done" and what hasn't.
* Dev. Team discusses what went well and what problems it ran into / how problems were solved.
* Dev. Team demonstrates the work that has "Done" and answer questions about the increment.
* Scrum Team collaborates on what do next, so that the Review provides valuable input to subsequent Plannings.

The result of this meetings is a revised Product Backlog that defines the next probable items on the Sprint.

#### Retrospective

Opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.

Retrospective occurs after the Review and prior to the next Planning. At most a 3 hour meeting for a one month sprint.

Scrum Master ensures that the meeting is positive and productive, and participates over accountability over the Scrum process.

* Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to relationships, process and tools;
* Identify and order major items that went well and potential improvements;
* Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way work is done.

Scrum master encourages better utilization of Scrum framework, to make it more enjoyable and effective.

The Scrum team plans ways to increase product quality by improving work process or adapting the definition of "Done", if appropriate and not conflicting with the organization standards.

The result are identified improvements that can be implemented in the next Sprint.

#### Artifacts

Provides transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation.

* Product Backlog
    * Ordered list of everything that is kown to be needed in the product
    * PO is responsible for content, availability and orderin

Attributes includes description, order, estimate and value. Ofter includes test descriptions that will prove its completeness when "Done".

#### Monitoring progress toward goals

* Burn-down
* Burn-ups
* Cumulative flows

#### Sprint Backlog
Forecast by the dev. team about what functionality will be in the next increment and the work needed to deliver that functionality into a "Done" increment. It should include at least one high priority process improvement identified in the previous Retrospective.

#### Transparency

It is the Scrum Master's job to increase transparency of the artifacts. It involves learning, convincing an change. Transparency does not occur over night, it is a path.

https://www.scrumguides.org/
## Scrum is an empirical process control theory
	- Knowledge comes from experience
	- Decisions is based on what is known
	### Empiricism is based on three pillars
		- Transparency 
			Aspects must be visible to those responsible for the outcome
		- Inspection
			Constant inspection must be done to detect undesirable variances
		- Adaptation
			If one or more aspects deviate outsite acceptable limits the process must be adjusted

		Four formal events are done to keep the pillars in check:
			- Sprint Planning
			- Daily Scrum
			- Sprint Review
			- Sprint Retrospective

		Five values should be embodied and lived by the scrum team:
			- Commitment to achieve goals
			- Courage to do the right think and work on tough problems
			- Focus on the work of the sprint and the goals of scrum team
			- Openness about the work challenges
			- Respect to each other as capable, independent people


	### Scrum Teams 
  Self organizing and cross-functional. Optimizing flexibility, creativity and productivity.
		Three parties:
			- Product Owner
				Responsible for maximizing the value of the product
					* Clearly expressing product backlog items
					* Ordering the items in the product backlog to best achiev goals and missions
					* Optimizing the value of the work the dev. team performs
					* Ensuring product backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all
					* Ensuring dev. team understands items to the level needed
				This work can be done by PO or let the devs do it, but PO remains accountable.
			- Dev. Team
				* Self-Organizing
				* Cross-Functional
				* No titles, regardless of the work being performed
				* No sub-teams, regardless of domains
				* Individuals may have specialized skills, but accountability belongs to  dev. team as a whole
				Fewer than three members decrease interaction and impacts in smaller productivity gains. More than nine members require too much coordination. PO and Scrum Master are excluded from this count.
